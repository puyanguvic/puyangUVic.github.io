**Introduction** I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada, under the supervision of [Dr. Lin Cai][1]. I obtained my MSc in Computer Technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, under the supervision of [Dr. Shining Li][2], where I also earned my BEng in Software Engineering. My current research areas include the analysis and design of network protocols, network protocols for data center networks, and distributed machine learning, with a special focus on the analysis and optimization of data-intensive services. I have a particular interest in fundamental research in computer networks. I am also a student member of IEEE.
